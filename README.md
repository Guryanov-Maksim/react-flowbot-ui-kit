## About

[React-flowbot-ui-kit](https://github.com/Hexlet/react-flowbot-ui-kit) - UI kit for creating a flowbot. It works as a widget that is embedded in a page. The user interacts with the bot by pressing buttons in chat and receives messages in response. Bot states are described in yaml format as a finite state machine. Inspired by [react-chatbot-kit](https://github.com/FredrikOseberg/react-chatbot-kit).
